Building out a clone of Amazon web app. I decided to build out this app because I wanted to build out a full stack app using a frontend, backend and database to build out a web app.

Using React to build out the frontend. I originally thought about doing a movie streaming app similar to netflix. But when I saw Amazon Luna video game app, I decided that I wanted to build out the architecture of that app as opposed to a more netflix streaming app. 

Using golang to build out the backend which is not the traditional route, but I wanted to learn how to use a garbage collector langauge. 
I was debating between golang and rust but decided that there was few enough use cases that it was better to go with golang. 

For the API I have been using RAWG to populate the games that I have been adding into the directory

I've decided I need to refactor my golang code so I will most likely start changing functions soon
